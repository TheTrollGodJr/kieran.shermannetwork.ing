- make program to backup images to a local device
- add a check to make sure the photos to be backed up aren't more than 7 days old
    - if they are, delete them.
- make the main index page mobile friendly
- make the picture time index page -- also needs to be mobile friendly
- add resume page
- redo functions for generating a video
    - these functions won't be used by the server
    - since all the data is being backed up locally, use the same program that backs them up to generate
    a new video/append to an existing video using the backup images.
    - this minimizes server storage usage
    - have an upload page to upload the video to be shown on the website -- require a key/password to upload
